Grid View
GRID VIEW
An adapter actually bridges between UI components and the data source that fill data into UI Component. Adapter can be used to supply the data to like spinner, list view, grid view etc.

The ListView and GridView are subclasses of AdapterView and they can be populated by binding them to an Adapter, which retrieves data from an external source and creates a View that represents each data entry.

Following are the important attributes specific to GridView

Specifies the gravity within each cell. Possible values are top, bottom, left, right, center, center_vertical, center_horizontal etc.

        Example
        This example will take you through simple steps to show how to create your own Android application using GridView. Follow the following steps to modify the Android application we created in Hello World Example chapter −

        Step	Description
        1	You will use Android studio IDE to create an Android application and name it as HelloWorld under a package com.example.helloworld as explained in the Hello World Example chapter.
        2	Modify the detault content of res/layout/activity_main.xml file to include GridView content with the self explanatory attributes.
        3	No need to change string.xml, Android studio takes care of defaults strings which are placed at string.xml
        4	Let's put few pictures in res/drawable-hdpi folder. I have put sample0.jpg, sample1.jpg, sample2.jpg, sample3.jpg, sample4.jpg, sample5.jpg, sample6.jpg and sample7.jpg.
        5	Create a new class called ImageAdapter under a package com.example.helloworld that extends BaseAdapter. This class will implement functionality of an adapter to be used to fill the view.
        6	Run the application to launch Android emulator and verify the result of the changes done in the application."
